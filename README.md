# sobreMesa

**Drescription:** This MERN application idea arose from my interest in collecting the delicious meals prepared and shared across my huge ass Puerto Rican family. One of the ways my ancestors remain with me today is through their recipes, so taking care of recipes is one way to keep those loved ones close and well-remembered. I'd love to eventually deploy this app so that my actual family could use it. I've only begun building the app, the planned features are as follows:

##Features
  ### Must Haves
    * CRUD Functionality for recipes, users, and cookbooks
    * Authenticated login & protected routes
    * Slick, modern responsive UI using React library, Material-UI
    * In-depth filtering tool to search through created recipes
    * File uploads for recipe images and user profile
    * Random recipe generator for when user doesn't know when to cook
  ### Non-Essential Features I hope to have
    * When looking at displayed cook books, images of recipes that belong to it will display via a carousel feature
    * Utilize the Web Socket.io to effect event-driven responses & messages to server without user needing to poll/request to receive updated data.
  ### Features for when I'm mad advanced
    * Using a LLM (whether one I build or via API of someone else's) power a chatbot to give user suggestions and tips on how to cook or how to put a spin on the recipe (or maybe determine what goes well with what!).
